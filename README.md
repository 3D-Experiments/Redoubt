# Redoubt Printer


> :warning: **This project is still in beta**: Over many months the design has proven itself in the closed beta. However dedicated skirts for the z drives are still missing. Partial CAD is included to make any design as you wish.


Redoubt is entirely scratch design based on the efforts of the V2.2 for better performance, reliability and less maintenance.

- Integrated Sherpa Mini
- Ultra compact and anti-backlash swivel z-joints
- Heavy duty XY and Z belttensioning with one knob
- New CFD optimized partcooling ducts
- Reinforced XY joints
- Optimized for reduced belt wear
- Bearings with improved lifespan
- Quick-swap umbilical
- Carabiner support
- Reduced toolhead weight
- MGN12H support




Note: Enclosed Printers are passively heated and only designed around a 65C max chamber temperature, Redoubt is not intended to be a High Temperature printer. It was designed to excell at common engineering materials such as PLA, PETG, ABS and some PC/Nylon Blends
