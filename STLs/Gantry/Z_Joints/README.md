# Compact swivel z joints

The Y-endstop is now hidden inside one of the z joints. This gives the gantry a cleaner look. Wiring goes behind the nema17 to the z chain. The spacer got new fins that will avoid botteming out the M10 screw and cracking the plastic.

Use 2 M2 self tappers to lock the switch in place. Start with the left side to avoid tilting. The switch can be removed by pushing a small key through the hole on the back.
